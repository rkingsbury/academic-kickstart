The most remarkable thing about SpaceX isn't their rockets; it's their business model. Their ability to integrate testing brand new technology with paid satellite launches demonstrates how to innovate in massively risky areas without going broke.

## In the sky

It's hard not to be impressed by rocket ships that blast off into space, then turn around and land themselves on robotic barges. Ultimately, though, the SpaceX's mission is not just to build reusable spacecraft, but to colonize Mars. It's difficult to imagine an undertaking with more technical and financial (not to mention mortal) risk. 

Historically, private companies and the investors who back them haven't been willing to take such risky bets. SpaceX is, and they're succeeding.

Every time SpaceX launches a rocket, they get paid. Whether delivering payloads to the International Space Station or placing satellites into orbit, SpaceX is able to provide valuable services to NASA and other government agencies. These clients aren't paying SpaceX to do research; they're paying to put stuff in space.

And yet, every launch is also an experiment. The company's Falcon 9 rocket could reliably deliver payloads long before it was able to land itself and be re-used. As far as its customers were concerned, a launch was successful as soon as the payload was in orbit. That gave SpaceX the opportunity to  test its complicated landing systems on someone else's dime.

This strategy doesn't end with the landing system, either. Another significant challenge to landing on Mars is that the atmosphere is too thin to slow a big spacecraft down. SpaceX wants its craft to fire its thrusters in reverse while moving at high speed through the upper Martian atmosphere. This approach has never been tried before.

So, during every trip back to earth, the Falcon 9 performs this maneuver as it passes through a part of Earth's atmosphere that's similar in density to Mars'.

Dedicated tests of the landing system or high-speed reverse thrust would be enormously expensive to conduct on their own. But by piggybacking these high-risk experiments on top of low(er) risk satellite launches, SpaceX is able to stretch its research efforts and dollars much further. 

## In the lab

Laboratory research can benefit from the same approach. Many researchers have bold, innovative, risky new ideas they want to test, but finding funding for those ideas has become increasingly difficult. 

In a world where preliminary results are often essential to a successful grant application, recognizing opportunities to nest high-risk experiments within more routine, straightforward work (that is already funded) can greatly enhance blah blah blah.

There's an enormous up-front cost to most experiments. Whether in the form of expensive supplies or time-consuming sample preparation, in many cases the actual measurements are a relatively small part of an experiment. As such, running those samples through an additional analysis (even if not needed for the current test) can yield enormous time and cost savings.

Crucially, taking advantages of opportunities for piggybacking can equip us with that all-important preliminary data that will set our next grant proposal apart.

For many researchers, there is a disconnect between what we really want to study, and what we can find funding for. By looking for commonalities in sample preparation or measurement techniques between the two, we can generate the precious data we need to demonstrate bold new ideas.

It's not rocket science.
